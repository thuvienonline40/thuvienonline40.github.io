  <p>Upon downloading or utilizing the Application, you are automatically agreeing to the following terms. It is
    strongly advised that you thoroughly read and understand these terms prior to using the Application. Unauthorized
    copying, modification of the Application, any part of the Application, or our trademarks is strictly prohibited. Any
    attempts to extract the source code of the Application, translate the Application into other languages, or create
    derivative versions are not permitted. All trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property
    rights related to the Application remain the property of the Service Provider.</p><br>
  <p>The Service Provider is dedicated to ensuring that the Application is as beneficial and efficient as possible. As
    such, they reserve the right to modify the Application or charge for their services at any time and for any reason.
    The Service Provider assures you that any charges for the Application or its services will be clearly communicated
    to you.</p><br>
  <p>The Application stores and processes personal data that you have provided to the Service Provider in order to
    provide the Service. It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your phone and access to the Application.
    The Service Provider strongly advise against jailbreaking or rooting your phone, which involves removing software
    restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. Such actions could expose your
    phone to malware, viruses, malicious programs, compromise your phone's security features, and may result in the
    Application not functioning correctly or at all.</p>

    loss, direct or indirect, that you experience as a result of relying entirely on this functionality of the
    application.</p><br>
  <p>The Service Provider may wish to update the application at some point. The application is currently available as
    per the requirements for the operating system (and for any additional systems they decide to extend the availability
    of the application to) may change, and you will need to download the updates if you want to continue using the
    application. The Service Provider does not guarantee that it will always update the application so that it is
    relevant to you and/or compatible with the particular operating system version installed on your device. However,
    you agree to always accept updates to the application when offered to you. The Service Provider may also wish to
    cease providing the application and may terminate its use at any time without providing termination notice to you.
